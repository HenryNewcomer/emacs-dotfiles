Certainly! Here's the README.md file for your "emacs-dotfiles" repo:

# Emacs Dotfiles for MacOS

This repository contains dotfiles specifically for my MacOS devices.

## Contents

- [.zshrc](.zshrc): Main configuration file for zsh.

## Installation

After clonging the repo...

1. Ensure that the `install.sh` script is executable. If not, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
chmod +x install.sh
```

2. Run the `install.sh` script to append the contents of the `.zshrc` file to your existing `.zshrc`. This will merge the current configuration with the configurations provided in this repo.

```sh
./install.sh
```

3. Restart your terminal or source the `.zshrc` file to apply the changes:

```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```
